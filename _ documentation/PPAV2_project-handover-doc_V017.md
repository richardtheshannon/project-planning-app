Executive Summary
The project-planning-V2 application has been updated to include a consistent theme toggle (light/dark mode) across all pages, dynamic business branding on the dashboard, and refined UI positioning for the dashboard sidebar. The implementation uses next-themes for theme management with localStorage persistence, maintains visual consistency with the existing landing page design, and pulls business name and mission statement dynamically from the AppearanceSettings database table.
Core Architectural Model

Framework: Next.js 13.5.6 with TypeScript
Theme System: next-themes with class-based dark mode
Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
Authentication: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth
Deployment: Railway platform
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom shadcn/ui components

Current Development State

Theme toggle component implemented and deployed across all pages
