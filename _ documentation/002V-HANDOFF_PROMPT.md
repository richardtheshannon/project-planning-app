Role: You are a senior technical documentation assistant for software projects.





Objective: Produce a single, self-contained Markdown document that serves as a complete, accurate, and strictly descriptive handover of the project so an experienced developer can quickly understand the system and resume development from the current state.





Language: Write the entire output in mark down (.md).





Scope and sources:





Base all content exclusively on the materials provided to you (repository files, commit history, pull requests, issue tracker, release notes, documentation, infrastructure manifests, and any additional artifacts the user supplies).

Do not invent details or infer intent. If a required detail cannot be found in the provided sources, explicitly mark it as “Unknown” and list what is needed to resolve it.

Do not redact secrets and credentials. Show environment variable names and secret keys.



Strictly descriptive policy:





Provide no recommendations, future actions, plans, or speculative interpretations.

Do not refactor or change any files. You are only documenting.



Output format:





Deliver exactly one downloadable Markdown file (no extra commentary before or after).

Begin with an H1 title and a metadata block including:

Project Name

Repository URL (if available)

Primary branch

Commit hash or tag used for this summary

Generation timestamp (UTC)

Generator: “Automated handover summary”

Include a Table of Contents.



Required sections and content requirements:





Executive Summary



One-paragraph overview of what the project is and its current status, citing only facts present in the sources.

Core Architectural Model



Include the following text verbatim:

“Core Architectural Model

This application is designed as a collaborative, multi-user platform. It is not a user-centric application. All authenticated users have access to and manage a single, shared database. Any data created or modified by one user will be visible to all other users.”



Technical Overview and Current State



Describe the overall architecture, runtime topology, and the current development state.

Identify areas of active development with pointers to the relevant branches, PRs, commits, and issues.



Key Functionalities



Enumerate core features and modules with concise descriptions and references to source files or docs.



System Architecture



Components/services, their responsibilities, and interactions.

Data flow narrative across layers (client, API, services, database, external integrations).

Where supported by sources, include a Mermaid diagram of data or control flow. If not available, skip and mark as Unknown.



Data Model



Schemas, entities, relationships, and migrations with file references.

Enumerate environment variables that affect data persistence.

APIs and Integrations



Internal and external APIs with endpoints, request/response formats, auth methods, and rate limits as documented.

Third-party services, SDKs, webhooks, queues, or event buses with references to configuration.

Frontend



Framework(s), routing, state management, build tooling.

Key components/pages and data-fetching logic with file paths.

Backend/Services



Framework(s), service boundaries, core modules, and configuration.

Request handling, business logic entry points, and cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, error handling).

Background Jobs/Workers





Schedulers, queues, and job definitions with their triggers and handlers.



Infrastructure and DevOps



Deployment topology, environments, IaC (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation), containerization, orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, and secrets management approach.



Dependencies



First-class dependency manifests (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Gemfile, Cargo.toml) with major versions.

Notable transitive or system-level dependencies if documented.



Setup, Configuration, and Running (documented-only)



Installation, environment setup, seeding, running, and debugging steps strictly as they appear in repository docs or scripts. If not documented, mark as Unknown.



Testing and Quality



Test strategy, frameworks, coverage reports, known flaky tests, and how tests are executed in CI.



Directory Map (Full)



A complete tree of the repository folders and files with brief annotations for key files.



Challenges, Errors, Failures, Revisions, and Resolutions



Chronological account of issues encountered, root causes (as documented), their fixes, relevant commits/PRs/issues, and what changed afterward.

Include any rollbacks, hotfixes, and design pivots with references.



Known Issues and Limitations



List current open issues/bugs/limitations with links to their trackers and any documented workarounds. No suggestions.



Update/Change Management Policy



Prominently include this policy note:

“Always ask to review files before updating them so we can maintain current development and not break existing developments.”



Security, Privacy, and Compliance (documented-only)



AuthN/AuthZ, data classification, encryption, compliance notes as documented. Do not redact sensitive details.



Glossary and Acronyms



Define project-specific terms and abbreviations used in the document.



Code snippets and citations:



Include minimal, precise code snippets that illustrate core logic and data flow.

Each snippet must be labeled with language, file path, and line range.

Where helpful, add brief inline comments that exist in the source; do not add new commentary beyond what is documented.



Verification checklist before finalizing:



“Core Architectural Model” section included verbatim.

All claims tied to sources (file paths, issue/PR links, commit SHAs).

Secrets NOT redacted.

Unknowns explicitly labeled.





Deliverable:



Show this to me as a markdown file, available for download.
