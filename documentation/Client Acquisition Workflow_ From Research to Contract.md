### **Client Acquisition Workflow: From Research to Contract**

This workflow provides a flexible framework for an independent developer to manage the client acquisition process.

1. **Client Research**  
   * **Action:** Identify 5-10 potential clients who align with your skills and services. Research their business, identify a potential need, and find the right contact person (e.g., Head of Product, CTO, Marketing Manager).  
2. **Prepare First Contact**  
   * **Action:** Draft a personalized email or LinkedIn message for each of the top 3-5 prospects. Reference their specific company and a problem you believe you can help them solve. Avoid generic templates.  
3. **Send Initial Outreach**  
   * **Action:** Send the personalized messages you drafted. Log the outreach in a spreadsheet or your personal CRM.  
4. **Gentle Nudge (Optional)**  
   * **Action:** If you have a relevant piece of content (a blog post you wrote, a similar project in your portfolio), you can engage with the contact's content on a platform like LinkedIn. This is a soft-touch follow-up.  
5. **First Follow-Up**  
   * **Action:** If you haven't received a response from your initial outreach, send a brief and polite follow-up email after a reasonable amount of time has passed (e.g., 3-5 business days).  
   * **Example:** "Hi \[Name\], just wanted to gently follow up on my previous email regarding \[briefly state value proposition\]. If you have a moment this week, I'd love to connect. Thanks\!"  
6. **Schedule Discovery Call**  
   * **Goal:** The client has responded and is interested in talking.  
   * **Action:** Immediately reply with your availability or a scheduling link (like Calendly) to book a 20-30 minute discovery call.  
7. **Hold Discovery Call**  
   * **Action:** Conduct the discovery call. Focus on listening to the client's needs, challenges, and goals. Ask clarifying questions to ensure you fully understand the scope of their problem.  
8. **Draft Project Proposal**  
   * **Action:** Based on the discovery call, draft a detailed project proposal. Include:  
     * Your understanding of the problem.  
     * Your proposed solution.  
     * Project scope and deliverables.  
     * Timeline and milestones.  
     * Pricing and payment terms.  
9. **Send Proposal**  
   * **Action:** Send the proposal to the client. In the email, suggest a time to walk them through it and answer any questions.  
10. **Proposal Follow-Up**  
    * **Action:** If you haven't heard back after a few days, send a follow-up email.  
    * **Example:** "Hi \[Name\], I wanted to check in and see if you had a chance to review the proposal I sent over. I'm available to discuss it whenever you're ready."  
11. **Negotiation & Finalizing Scope**  
    * **Action:** The client has reviewed the proposal and wants to move forward, possibly with some adjustments. Schedule a call to negotiate terms, adjust the scope if needed, and come to a verbal agreement.  
12. **Prepare & Send Contract**  
    * **Action:** Once all terms are agreed upon, transfer the details from the final proposal into your standard independent contractor agreement. Send it to the client for their review and signature using a service like DocuSign or HelloSign.  
13. **Final Follow-Up on Contract**  
    * **Action:** If the contract hasn't been signed after a couple of days, a final, friendly nudge is appropriate.  
    * **Example:** "Hi \[Name\], just wanted to make sure you received the contract. Please let me know if you have any questions before signing. I'm excited to get started\!"  
14. **Contract Signed\!**  
    * **Action:** The client signs the contract. Send a welcome email outlining the next steps for onboarding and project kickoff.
